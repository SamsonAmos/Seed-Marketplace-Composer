## About The Project

The Seed Marketplace is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Celo blockchain, allowing farmers to list seeds, and buyers to purchase them using cUSD (Celo Dollar). The platform provides a transparent, efficient, and decentralized way for farmers and buyers to interact, while leveraging blockchain technology for secure transactions. It supports the following core functionalities:

## Features included:

- A function that allows farmers to list their seeds with details like name, price, description, quantity, and an image.
- A function to view detailed information of each seed listing by index.
- A function to purchase seeds using cUSD.
- A function to allow users to add comments on each seed listing.
- A function to delete seed listings and associated comments (only the farmer who listed the seed can delete it).

## The Seed Marketplace is built using the Celo blockchain and modern front-end technologies to provide a seamless experience for users.
